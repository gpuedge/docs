For farming on GPUX it is recommended to have a good balance of CPU cores and RAM per GPU. Atleast 2 cores per GPU is the bare minimum along with 4GB of ram. High IOPS NVME drive is very important along with 1Gbps symetrical internet but not a must.

#### Network
 - Bridge ISP modem into good router (pfsense/linux)
 - 1Gbps down/up Fibre or 10Gbps if available
 - Consumer SmartSwitch for Port Isolation

#### Motherboard
 - Gen3/4 PCIE lanes (more expensive boards have better lane configurations)
 - Risers are OK
 - Dual Gbps RJ45 or 10Gbe is nice to have

#### Disk
 - High IOPS NVME like Samsung 980 PRO
 - Distant second SSD
 - No Harddrives

#### CPU
 - High clock Ryzen 5950x is good
 - Refurb 2nd/3rd Gen Xeons are good
 - Older gen CPUs not so good

#### GPUs
 - Anything RTX and up
 - RTX3060 LHR
 - RTX3080 (Ti)
 - A100 / A4000-6000
